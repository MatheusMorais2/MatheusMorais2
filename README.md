## Why is coding so fascinating?

<p>To me, accessibility and democracy are at the core of it all.<br>
 When I was in college, I had to go to ask a professor permission to use the lab, go to the lab, set everything up, get a few shocks to be able to measure a resistor.<br>
 Nowadays, with my knowledge of programming, I can just emulate the circuit and get all the data in a nice matrix. We can change the world, we can include people that were otherwise excluded and we can share freely.<br>
 That is the beaty of coding and that's why I'm in love with it!</p>

## What are you working on?

<p>I'm on a journey to be a Full-stack web developer and am being tutored by the most amazing people at Driven Education and, to answer your question, probably working on a web page project that you can see bellow ðŸ˜„</p>
